Community groups on Discord and WeChat have been established to facilitate better interaction and learning. These platforms will be periodically used for answering questions and providing guidance to the community.

**Course Development:**
An AI-assisted art creation course focused on character design is underway. The course is expected to be completed by the end of June, offering users a systematic guide to harness the potential of AIGC in their artistic endeavors.

### Upcoming Activities:

### Challenges and Risks:
While we continue to make good progress, we need to ensure regular content uploads and prompt responses to community queries to sustain user engagement and interest.

### Conclusion:
The project continues to make significant strides towards achieving its goals. The team remains committed to empowering more individuals to leverage AI-generated content in their creative endeavors.
