## Key Achievements

During this iteration, we've made significant progress in our project AIGC101. Here are the key contributions I made:

1. **AI Open Source Community Website Framework**: I've managed to construct a preliminary website framework for our AI Open Source Community. This structure will serve as the foundation of our platform where users can access resources, collaborate, and share knowledge.

2. **Repository on Github**: To organize our resources, I have set up a repository on Github. This repository is crucial for maintaining and managing our collected resources such as tutorials and tools.

3. **Collection of Tutorials and Tools**: In the effort to kickstart our resources database, I have started to gather and categorize various AI-related tutorials and tools. These resources are crucial for educating users about AI-generated content and helping them in their creative endeavors.

## Next Steps

Moving forward, I plan to focus on the following tasks:

1. **Further Develop the Website**: We will enrich the website with more functionalities and improved user interface. We aim to make the website more user-friendly and intuitive to navigate.

2. **Expand our Github Repository**: We will continue to add more quality resources to our Github repository. More specifically, we will focus on collecting more tutorials and tools related to AI-generated content.

3. **Community Building**: We will start to attract users to our platform and build a supportive community. We aim to create an environment where individuals can learn from each other and push the boundaries of creativity.

I'm confident that with the team's continuous efforts, we will make Project AIGC101 a valuable resource for individuals seeking to unlock the potential of AI-generated content in their creative pursuits.
